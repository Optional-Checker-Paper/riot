{project-title} requires Java and the easiest option is to use the version packaged with Ubuntu.
By default Ubuntu 18.04 includes Open JDK 11.

To install this version, first update the package index:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt update
----

Next, check if Java is already installed:

[source,console]
----
java -version
----
 
If Java is not currently installed, youâ€™ll see the following output:

[source,console]
----
Command 'java' not found, but can be installed with:

sudo apt install default-jre
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
----

Execute the following command to install the default Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which will install the JRE from OpenJDK 11:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install default-jre
----
 
Verify the installation with:

[source,console]
----
java -version
----
 
You should see output similar to the following:

[source,console]
