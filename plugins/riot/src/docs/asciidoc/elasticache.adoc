= Migrate from Elasticache

This recipe contains step-by-step instructions to migrate an Elasticache (EC) database to https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/[Redis Enterprise] (RE).

The following scenarios are covered:

* One-time (snapshot) migration
* Online (live) migration

WARNING: Please note that the tool used in this recipe ({project-title}) is NEITHER recommended NOR officially supported by Redis, Inc.

IMPORTANT: It is recommended to read the https://developer.redis.com/riot/riot-redis/[{project-title} documentation] to familiarize yourself with its usage and architecture.

== Setup

=== Prerequisites

For this recipe you will require the following resources:
 
* AWS ElastiCache: _Primary Endpoint_ in case of Single Master and _Configuration Endpoint_ in case of Clustered EC.
+
Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Endpoints.html[this link] to learn more
* Redis Enterprise: hosted on Cloud or On-Prem
* An Amazon EC2 instance

[IMPORTANT]
.Keyspace Notifications
====
For a https://developer.redis.com/riot/riot-redis/#live-replication[live migration] you need to https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elasticache-redis-keyspace-notifications/[enable keyspace notifications] on your Elasticache instance.
====

=== Migration Host

To run the migration tool we will need an EC2 instance.

You can either create a new EC2 instance or leverage an existing one if available.
In the example below we first create an instance on AWS Cloud Platform.
The most common scenario is to access an ElastiCache cluster from an Amazon EC2 instance in the same Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
We have used Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for this setup but you can choose any Ubuntu or Debian distribution of your choice.
 
SSH to this EC2 instance from your laptop:

[source,console]
----
ssh -i “public key” <AWS EC2 Instance>
----

Install `redis-cli` on this new instance by running this command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y redis-tools
----

Use `redis-cli` to check connectivity with the Elasticache database:

[source,console]
----
redis-cli -h <elasticache primary endpoint> -p 6379
----

Ensure that the above command allows you to connect to the remote Elasticache database successfully.


=== Installing {project-title}

Let's install {project-title} on the EC2 instance we set up previously.

== Performing Migration

We are now all set to begin the migration process.
The options you will use depend on your source and target databases, as well as the replication mode (snapshot or live).

=== EC Single Master -> RE

[source,console]
----
riot-redis -h <source EC host> -p <source EC port> replicate -h <target RE host> -p <target RE port> --pass <RE password>
----

=== Live EC Single Master -> RE
[source,console,subs="+quotes"]
----
riot-redis -h <source EC host> -p <source EC port> replicate *[blue]#--mode live#* -h <target RE host> -p <target RE port> --pass <RE password>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
In case ElastiCache is configured with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/auth.html[AUTH TOKEN enabled], you need to pass `--tls` as well as `--pass` option:
[source,console,subs="+quotes"]
----
riot-redis -h <source EC host> -p <source EC port> *[blue]#--tls --pass <token>#* replicate -h <target RE host> -p <target RE port> --pass <RE password>
----
====

=== EC Cluster -> RE

[source,console,subs="+quotes"]
----
riot-redis -h <source EC host> -p <source EC port> *[blue]#--cluster#* replicate -h <target RE host> -p <target RE port> --pass <RE password>
----

NOTE: `--cluster` is an important parameter used ONLY for ElastiCache whenever cluster-mode is enabled.
Do note that the source database is specified first and the target database is specified after the replicate command and it is applicable for all the scenarios.

=== EC Single Master -> RE (with specific DB namespace)

[source,console,subs="+quotes"]
----
riot-redis -h <source EC host> -p <source EC port> *[blue]#--db <index>#* replicate -h <target RE host> -p <target RE port> --pass <RE password>
----

=== EC Single Master -> RE with OSS Cluster
[source,console,subs="+quotes"]
----
riot-redis -h <source EC host> -p <source EC port> replicate -h <target RE host> -p <target RE port> --pass <RE password> *[blue]#--cluster#*
----

=== Live EC Cluster -> RE with OSS Cluster

[source,console,subs="+quotes"]
----
riot-redis -h <source EC host> -p <source EC port> *[blue]#--cluster#* replicate *[blue]#--mode live#* -h <target RE host> -p <target RE port> --pass <RE password> *[blue]#--cluster#*
----

== Important Considerations

* As stated earlier, this tool is not officially supported by Redis Inc.
* It is recommended to test migration in UAT before production use.
* Once migration is completed, ensure that application traffic gets redirected to Redis Enterprise Endpoint successfully.
* It is recommended to perform the migration process during low traffic so as to avoid chances of data loss.

== Troubleshooting

=== Authentication Required
You might face this error message while running the migration tool:

[source,console]
----
Could not write record: NOAUTH
Authentication required
----

This issue occurs when you fail to supply the `--pass <password>` parameter while running the `riot-redis replicate` command.
