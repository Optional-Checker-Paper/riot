{project-title} processes data in batch fashion: a fixed number of records (batch AKA chunk) is read, processed, and written at a time.
Then the cycle is repeated until there's no more data on the source.

[[batch]]
== Batching

The default batch size is 50, which means that an execution step reads 50 items at a time from the source, processes them, and finally writes then to the target.
If the target is Redis, writing is done in a single command https://redis.io/topics/pipelining[pipeline] to minimize the number of roundtrips to the server.

You can change the batch size (and hence pipeline size) using the `--batch` option.
The optimal batch size in terms of throughput depends on a few factors like record size and command types (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/32165090[here] for details).

[[threads]]
== Multi-threading

It is possible to parallelize processing by using multiple threads.
In that configuration, each chunk of items is read, processed, and written in a separate thread of execution.
This is different from partitioning where items would be read by multiple readers.
Here, only one reader is being accessed from multiple threads.

To set the number of threads use the `--threads` option.
