Redis Input/Output Tools ({project-title}) is a command-line utility to get data in and out of any Redis-compatible database like Redis OSS, Redis Cluster, Redis Enterprise, or <<_elasticache, Amazon ElastiCache>>.

{project-title} allows you to:

* Import data into a Redis database
* Export data from a Redis database
* Replicate (migrate) data between two Redis databases

{project-title} supports many different sources and targets:

* Files (CSV, JSON, XML)
* Data generators (data structures, Faker)
* Relational databases
* Redis itself (snapshot and live replication)

{project-title} processes data in batch fashion: a fixed number of records (batch AKA chunk) is read, processed, and written at a time.
Then the cycle is repeated until there's no more data on the source.

Import commands (<<_file_import,`file-import`>>, <<_db_import,`db-import`>>, <<_faker_import,`faker-import`>>) construct keys from input records by concatenating a keyspace prefix and fields.
