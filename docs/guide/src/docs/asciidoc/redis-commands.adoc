= Redis commands

You must specify at least one Redis command as a target.

The keys that will be written are constructed from input records by concatenating the keyspace prefix and key fields.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Redis connection options apply to the root command (`riot`) and not to subcommands.

In this example the redis options will not be taken into account:
