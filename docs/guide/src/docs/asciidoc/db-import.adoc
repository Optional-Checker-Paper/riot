[[_db_import]]
= Database Import

The `db-import` command imports data from a relational database into Redis.

NOTE: Ensure RIOT has the relevant JDBC driver for your database.
See the <<_database_drivers,Drivers>> section for more details.

[source]
----
riot -h <redis host> -p <redis port> db-import --url <jdbc url> SQL [REDIS COMMAND...]
----

To show the full usage, run:

[source]
----
riot db-import --help
----

You must specify at least one Redis command as a target.

The keys that will be written are constructed from input records by concatenating the keyspace prefix and key fields.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Redis connection options apply to the root command (`riot`) and not to subcommands.

In this example the redis options will not be taken into account:

[source]
----
riot db-import "SELECT * FROM customers" hset -h myredis.com -p 6380
----

.PostgreSQL Example
[source]
----
include::{testdir}/db-import-postgresql[]
----

.Import from PostgreSQL to JSON strings
[source]
----
include::{testdir}/db-import-postgresql-set[]
----

This will produce Redis strings that look like this:

include::{includedir}/../resources/order.json[]
