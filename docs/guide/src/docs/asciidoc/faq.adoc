== Importing

.`Unknown options: '--keyspace', '--keys'`

You must specify one or more Redis commands with import commands (<<_file_import,`file-import`>>, <<_faker_import,`faker-import`>>, <<_db_import,`db-import`>>).

== Replication

.`ERR DUMP payload version or checksum are wrong`

Redis 7 DUMP format is not backwards compatible with previous versions.
To replicate between different Redis versions use <<_replicate_type_based,Type-Based Replication>>.

.Process gets stuck during replication and eventually times out

This could be due to big keys clogging the replication pipes. Check the database with `redis-cli` {link_bigkeys} and/or use the <<_source_reader_options,source reader options>> to filter these keys out.
