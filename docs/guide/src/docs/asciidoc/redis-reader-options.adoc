`--scan-count`::
    How many keys to read at once on each call to https://redis.io/commands/scan#the-count-option[SCAN]
`--scan-match`::
    Pattern of keys to replicate (default: `*` i.e. all keys)
`--scan-type`::
    Type of keys to replicate (default: all types)  
`--key-include`::
    Regular expressions for keys to whitelist.
    For example `mykey:.*` will only replicate keys starting with `mykey:`.
`--key-exclude`::
    Regular expressions for keys to blacklist.
    For example `mykey:.*` will not replicate keys starting with `mykey:`.
`--key-slots`::
    Ranges of key slots to include for replication.
    For example `0:8000` will only transfer keys that fall within the range `0` to `8000`.
`--reader-threads`::
    How many value reader threads to use in parallel
`--reader-batch`::
    Number of keys each reader thread should dump at once in a pipelined call
`--reader-queue`::
    Max number of items that reader threads can put in the shared queue.
    When the queue is full reader threads wait for space to become available.
    Queue size should be at least *#threads * batch*, e.g. `--reader-threads 4 --reader-batch 500` => `--reader-queue 2000`
`--reader-pool`::
    Size of the connection pool shared by reader threads.
    Can be smaller than the number of threads
`--read-from`::
   Which Redis cluster nodes to read from: `master`, `master_preferred`, `upstream`, `upstream_preferred`, `replica_preferred`, `replica`, `lowest_latency`, `any`, `any_replica`.
